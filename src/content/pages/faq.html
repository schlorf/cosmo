                            To maintain optimal oral health, follow these essential practices: Brush your teeth twice daily for two minutes using fluoride toothpaste and a soft-bristled brush. Floss once a day to clean between teeth where brushing can't reach. Consider using an antimicrobial mouthwash after brushing and flossing. Maintain a healthy diet low in sugary and acidic foods, and drink plenty of water to rinse away food particles. Visit your dentist regularly for checkups and cleanings, replace your toothbrush every few months, and avoid smoking. These habits will help prevent cavities, gum disease, and other oral health issues while promoting overall well-being.
